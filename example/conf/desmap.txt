# This file is used to map remote sources to destination folders.

# Aternatively you can set the property 'use_netloc' to True in /resync/conf/config.txt. If using netloc,
# the hostname of the sources is used as destination folder and no source to destination mapping is needed.
# However, multiple sources from the same host might be in conflict and overwrite resources that happen to have the
# same (sub) path.
#
# Format is {source}={destination}
# If {destination} is a relative path than it is relative to the root path given in the property 'destination_root'
# in /resync/conf/config.txt.
#
# Examples:
# http://somehost.com:/srv/source1/loc1=destination1a
# http://somehost.com:/srv/source1/loc2=destination1b
# http://otherhost.nl/source2/=destination2
# http://yetanother.edu:/path/to/source3=/absolute/destination
